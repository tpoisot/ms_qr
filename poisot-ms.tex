\begin{abstract} Measuring the modularity of networks, and how it deviates
from random expectations, important to understand their structure and
emerging properties. Several measures exist to assess modularity, which when
applied to the same network, can return both different modularity values
(\emph{i.e.} different estimates of how modular the network is) and different
module compositions (\emph{i.e.} different groups of species forming said
modules). More importantly, as each optimization method uses a different
optimization criterion, there is a need to have an \emph{a posteriori}
measure serving as an equivalent of a goodness-of-fit. In this article, I
propose such a measure of modularity, which is simply defined as the ratio
of interactions established between members of the same modules \emph{vs.}
members of different modules. I apply this measure to a large dataset of 290
ecological networks representing host--parasite (bipartite) and predator--prey
(unipartite) interactions, to show how the results are easy to interpret and
present especially to a broad audience not familiar with modularity analyses,
but still can reveal new features about modularity and the ways to measure it.

\section{Introduction}

Modularity, the fact that groups of nodes within a network interact more
frequently with themselves than with other nodes, is an important property of
several systems, including genetic \parencite{espinosa-soto_specialization_2010,bauer-mehren_gene-disease_2011}, informatics
\parencite{fortuna_evolution_2011}, ecological
\parencite{olesen_modularity_2007}, and socio-economic
\parencite{saavedra_strong_2011} interactions, as well as biogeographic
patterns \cite{carstensen_biogeographical_2011,thebault_identifying_2012} and disease
spread management \cite{chades_general_2011}. Because of the relevance of
modularity for network properties, it is important to assess it correctly.
There exists several methods to measure network modularity, some of which rely
on the optimization of a given criterion
\cite{newman_modularity_2006,zhang_optimization_2008}, label propagation
\cite{barber_modularity_2007}, or combination of these approaches
\cite{liu_community_2010,marquitti_modular:_2013}. These methods return two elements. The first is a
value of modularity for the networks, most often within the 0\,--\,1 interval.
Each method often has a threshold value, above which a network is considered
to be modular. Increasing values reflect and increasingly modular structure.
The second element is a ``community partition'', \emph{i.e.} the attribution
of each node to a module.

Recently, \textcite{thebault_identifying_2012} showed that different
measures of modularity tailored to presence/absence matrices (\emph{i.e.}
networks in which links have no weight), gave roughly equal estimates of
the significance of modularity, but differed in the community partition they
returned (\emph{i.e.} the identity of nodes composing each module varied). In
such situations, one might look for a way to choose which community partition
should be used. The challenge is this situation is that the citeria used by
each optimisation method cannot be meaningfully compared, and so there is a
need for \emph{a posteriori} measurement of how strong the modular structure
is, regardless of the method used to obtain the community partition. More
importantly, this criterion should be \emph{different} than the one used to
track the progress of any optimisation algorithm.

An important feature of modular networks is the occurrence of interactions
between nodes of different modules. They contribute to the propagation of
disturbances \parencite{olesen_modularity_2007}, flow of information
\cite{wiederhold_mediators_1992,leskovec_statistical_2008}, and cross-
regulation of biological processes \cite{hartwell_molecular_1999}, \emph{inter
alia} \cite{rosvall_maps_2008}. In addition to measuring how modular the
network is, determining to what extent modules are connected, and to
identify nodes and edges responsible for connecting modules, is thus 
valuable information. In this article, I propose an \emph{a posteriori}
measure of the proportion of interactions established between modules,
\emph{i.e.} edges connecting different communities. I apply this measure to
the community partition identified by the Louvain method on 290 ecological
networks, and show that it behaves in a similar way to other modularity
measures.

\section{The measure}

In this contribution I define the \emph{realized modularity}, termed $Q_R$.
$Q_R$ measures the extent to which edges, within a network, are established
between nodes belonging to the same module. For $E$ edges in a network, if $W$
of them are established between members of the same module, then

\begin{equation}
Q_R = \frac{W}{E} .
\label{e:qr}
\end{equation} 

When there are no between-module links, then $W = E$ and $Q_R$ takes the
maximal value of 1. When between-module interactions are as numerous as
within-modules interactions, then $W = E/2$, and $Q_R$ takes the minimal value
of 1/2. To express the \emph{realized modularity} as a value between 0 and 1,
it is expressed as:

\begin{equation}
Q_R' = 2\times Q_R - 1 .
\label{e:tqr}
\end{equation}

Note that $Q_R'$ will yield values in the $[0;1]$ interval only if there are
more edges established \emph{within} than \emph{between} modules. Although if
modules are determined at random, $Q_R'$ values are expected to be centered on
0, it is expected that they will increase when modules are properly optimized
(only as far as the network is modular).

The main advantage of $Q_R$ is that it is agnostic with regard to the measure
used to optimize modularity (and even to the method by which the nodes were
assigned to modules, which can be arbitrary), as it acts \emph{a posteriori},
\emph{i.e.} after nodes have been attributed to modules. Nonetheless, it
assumes a simple yet functional definition of modularity: the fact that
nodes interact more within than between modules. Given that measuring to
which extent this is true, it can therefore be used to select the community
detection method maximizing modularity. This measure works on most type
of networks, as it makes no difference if links are directional, or if
the networks are bipartite/unipartite. An illustration of this measure
is given in Figure~\ref{f:illu}. This measure is purposefully simple,
(i) so that it makes only minimal assumptions about what modularity is
(except for the fact that in a modular network, nodes interact more within
than between modules), or how it should be optimized, and (ii) because it
is not meant to be used to optimize modularity, but to either compare the
outcome of different methods, or present the value of modularity in a way
that is straigthforward to interpretate.

\begin{figure}[tb]

\caption{A cartoon depiction of a modular network with links between modules. Nodes of the same modules are identified by different colors. This network has a modularity (Louvain method) of $Q = 0.527$. Out of the 36 interactions, 31 are established within modules, and 5 between modules. This gives a $Q_R$ value of 0.86, and $Q_R' = 0.72$.}
\label{f:illu}
\end{figure}

A python implementation of this measure, using the \texttt{networkx} package,
is proposed at \texttt{https://gist.github.com/tpoisot/4947006}. It reads data in the edge list
format, and offers additional functions to generate null networks, as detailed
in the following section.

\section{Example application: realized modularity in ecological networks}

In this section, I analyze the modular structure of a large dataset of 290
ecological networks (187 food webs and 113 host-parasite networks) published in
previous meta-analyses \cite{gravel_trophic_2011,poisot_dissimilarity_2012}.
Modularity is an important feature of ecological interaction networks, which is
linked to their resilience
\cite{fortuna_nestedness_2010,stouffer_compartmentalization_2011}, stability
\parencite{thebault_identifying_2012}, biogeographic structure
\cite{flores_multi-scale_2012}, functioning \cite{thebault_food-web_2003}, and
to the evolutionary mechanisms involved in their assembly
\cite{flores_statistical_2011}. Notably, the occurrence of interactions between
and within modules plays a central role in the structure of pollination
networks \parencite{olesen_modularity_2007}, and help buffer the effect of
species extinctions \parencite{stouffer_compartmentalization_2011}.

The existence of interactions in ecological systems involves a large family of
processes, ranging from abudance related
\cite{bluthgen_measuring_2006,canard_emergence_2012} (abundant species are more
likely to interact together) to trait related
\cite{bartomeus_understanding_2013} (pollination depends on the flower and
insect having compatible morphologies, predators are constrained by the
body-size of their preys). The interaction within these different families of
mechanisms will drive heterogeneity in interaction strength
\cite{berlow_quantifying_1999}. Yet, the analysis of binary matrices (is there
an interaction between a pair of species, or not), still has relevance to
identify properties that are conserved across systems
\cite{dunne_network_2006}, especially given that one could argue that
quantitative information on interaction strength is an additional level of
information. The systems analyzed in this section are represented by their
adjacency matrix, describing the presence or absence of an interaction.

\subsection{Data and analysis}

I used the Louvain method \cite{blondel_fast_2008} to detect modules, due to
its rapidity and efficiency on large networks. The Louvain method works in two
steps: first it optimizes modularity \emph{locally}, through clustering of
neighboring nodes. These clusters are, in the second steps, aggregated
together, until modularity ceases to increase. This method is known to give
values of modularity comparable to what is found using \emph{e.g.} simulated
annealing, and has been observed to give modules that have a functional
relevance \cite{blondel_fast_2008}.  Once the partition is returned by the
Louvain method, I recorded its realized modularity $Q_R'$, and its modularity
$Q$ (using the \textcite{newman_finding_2004} measure).

For each network, I compared the values of $Q$ and $Q_R'$ on the empirical
networks to their random estimate using a network null model. Because random
networks will by chance (here meaning, as expected by networks having a
given connectance and thus degree distribution, \textcite{poisot_when_2013})
display a modular (among other) structure, it is important to confront the
empirical measures of both $Q$ and $Q'_R$ to their random expectations. The
null model is defined as follows. For each node $n$ of the network, I measured
its degree $d_n$, its number of successors(the number of node it links to,
or generality in ecological terms, as \emph{per} \cite{schoener_food_1989})
$g_n$, and its number of predecessors (the number of nodes that link to it,
or vulnerability) $v_n$. In each random network, for each pair of nodes
$(i,j)$, the probability that $i$ interacts with $j$ is given by

\begin{equation}
P(i\rightarrow j) = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{g_i}{d_i}+\frac{v_j}{d_j}\right),
\label{e:null}
\end{equation}

\noindent and conversely for $P(j \rightarrow i)$. This null model allowed
the generation of pseudo-random networks through a Bernoulli process (in
each replicate, the occurrence of a link is randomly determined), with the
same expected connectance, and the same expected distribution of degrees,
generality, and vulnerability, as the original one (these properties are
also conserved at the \emph{node} level).  For each of the 290 networks,
1000 pseudo-random replicates are generated. For each of them, the average
value of $Q_R$ and $Q_R'$ are estimated along with their 90\% confidence
interval. When the empirical value lies outside the confidence interval,
it can be assumed that the modular structure of the network is different
than expected by chance.

\subsection{Results and Discussion}

\label{f:qqr}
\end{figure}

There is a strong, positive relationship, between the values of $Q_R'$ and
the values of $Q$ (Pearsons's product-moment correlation coefficient, as
implemented in \texttt{R 2.15} \cite{team_r:_2008}, $\rho = 0.64$, 288 d.f.,
$p < 10^{-6}$), \emph{i.e.} networks for which a high modularity is detected
tend to have relatively few between-module links (Figure~\ref{f:qqr}). It
is worth noting that some $Q_R'$ values were negative: in some cases, the
best community division resulted in more interactions between than within
modules. This result highlights why using an \emph{a posteriori} measure is
useful: other measures of modularity do not reveal the fact that there were
more interactions between than within modules. In the dataset examined,
most of the networks with a modularity lower than 0.2 had a negative
realized modularity. This result suggests that discussing the modularity
of such networks makes little sense, as their modules are not more densely
connected, within a module, than other random collections of nodes within
the graph. $Q$ and $Q_R'$ have different relationships with connectance
(Figure~\ref{f:co}). Increased connectance values resulted in lower modularity
($\rho = -0.61$, 288 d.f., $p < 10^{-6}$), but had no impact on $Q_R'$. This
is a desirable property, as it allows easy comparison with the $Q_R'$ values
of networks with extremely different connectances.

\end{center}
\caption{Relationship between the two measures of modularity and network connectance. \textbf{A.} $Q$ is negatively affected by connectance, \emph{i.e.} densely connected networks are more likely not to be modular. \textbf{B.} $Q_R'$ is not affected by connectance, allowing to use it to compare different networks.

\label{f:co}
\end{figure}

There is a linear relationship between the deviation from random
expectation of $Q$ and $Q_R'$ ($\rho = 0.78$, 288 d.f., $p < 10^{-6}$
-- Figure~\ref{f:dnull}). The deviations (respectively $\Delta Q$ and
$\Delta Q_R'$) are calculated as the empirical value, minus the average
of the values on the networks generated by the null model. As an example,
a $\Delta Q$ less than zero indicates that the empirical network is less
modular than expected by chance. Confidence intervals for the average of
the null models were typically very narrow (not represented in the figure to
avoid cluttering -- see associated original dataset), probably owing to the
fact that the null model is restrictive on the type of networks which are
generated. It is worth noting that for some networks, the diagnostic of the
null model analysis conflicted.  In a vast majority of the situations, this
corresponds to networks having a lower modularity than expected by chance,
yet having a higher realized modularity (dots in the upper left corner of
Fig. \ref{f:dnull}). In this type of situations, whereas one would usually
conclude that the networks are not significantly modular, the identified
modules are nonetheless more densely connected (internally) than they are
with the rest of the network. Depending on whether the true modularity, or
the realized modularity, is the most relevant metric of the processes studied,
the interpretation of the null models for these networks will be different.

\end{center}
\caption{Linear relationship between the deviation from random expectation in $Q$ and $Q_R'$. Networks in the red area are detected as being less modular than expected both by $Q_R'$ and $Q$, while networks in the blue area are detected as being more modular.

Each dot correspond to a network.}
\label{f:dnull}
\end{figure}

Finally, for the unipartite network dataset, I compare the results of three
alternative methods of community detection (the walktrap, spinglass, and edge
betweeness methods, as implemented in the \emph{igraph} library). For each of
the unipartite networks, I computed the value of Barber's $Q$, and $Q_R'$, on
the best partition found. The strong correlation between $Q$ and $Q_R'$ were
observed for the spinglass method (r = 0.61, df = 165, t = 10.02), and the
weakest for the edge-betweenness method (r = 0.04, non-significant at $\alpha =
0.05$). The walktrap algorithm gave results in between (r = 0.489, df = 165, t
= 7.20). For both the walktrap and edge-betweeness methods, several networks
had negative values of $Q_R'$, which indicates that the ``best'' community
partition had more links between than within modules. The spinglass method had,
by contrast, less than 8\% of all networks with values of $Q_R'$ lower than 0,
meaning that this algorithm should be prefered when one wants to group nodes in
densely connected clusters.

\section{Conclusions}

The $Q_R'$ measure presented here allows the estimation of the proportion of
interactions established between different modules in a network. This measure
can be analyzed much in the same way as other measures of modularity, but is
applied \emph{a posteriori}. As such, it can help choose the ``best''
community partition according to the property of the network that one wants to
maximize. For example, choosing the partition giving the lowest $Q_R'$ can help
identify which species are more likely to act as connectors between different
modules. Ultimately, this information may have some practical relevance as a
decision tool. \textcite{saavedra_strong_2011} showed that different nodes
contribute differently to overall network properties. In a context in which
networks are increasingly being used as management tools to adress \emph{e.g.}
conservation or pest management \cite{chades_general_2011}, knowing the
realized modularity, and developping methods to estimate which species have the
highest impact on it, can allow the design of efficient policies to maximize, or
decrease, the ability of network modules to interact.
